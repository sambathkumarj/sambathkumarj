### 🛠️ Projects
-  Gained experience with networking protocols such as HTTP, DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP, etc.
-  Worked on cloud and virtual infrastructure like VM, Hypervisor & ESXi, and demonstrated experience in Linux OS and network troubleshooting.
-  Successfully deployed a 5G Core NFV as microservices on Kubernetes and Docker, enabling the implementation of a complete 5G network with a 5G RAN.
-  The Telco-Edge-Stack, deployment of Open5GS, an open-source 5G core network software, leveraging NFV (Network Function Virtualization). This deployment is orchestrated within Kubernetes, orchestrated on top of Aether( an open-source 5G platform for edge computing) on bare-metal servers.✔️Gained experience with networking protocols such as HTTP, DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP, etc.

-  Collecting logs from Kubernetes resources using Telegraf, which syncs seamlessly with InfluxDB, a time series database. This setup allows efficient data retrieval from microservices and ensures system reliability and performance with monitoring tools, Grafana.
-  Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Gitlab, and deployed & managed Kubernetes clusters for microservices deployment.
-  Developed automation scripts with Bash and Python to streamline system maintenance and managed and scaled Kubernetes clusters for microservices architecture.
-  Trained an AI object detection model with Roboflow and Ultralytics, then deployed it on NVIDIA AI edge devices for real-time object recognition.
